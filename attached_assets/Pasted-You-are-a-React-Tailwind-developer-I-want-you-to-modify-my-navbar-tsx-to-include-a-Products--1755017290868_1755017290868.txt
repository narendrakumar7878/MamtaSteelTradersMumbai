You are a React + Tailwind developer.
I want you to modify my `navbar.tsx` to include a **Products** dropdown menu with these items:
- Bars → /bars
- Flanges → /flanges
- Fittings → /fittings
- Fasteners → /fasteners

Each of these should link to a separate page with its own component file in `src/pages/`.

**Tasks:**
1. Create 4 new files in `src/pages/`:
   - Bars.tsx
   - Flanges.tsx
   - Fittings.tsx
   - Fasteners.tsx

2. Content for `Bars.tsx`:
   - Title: "Round Bar"
   - Description: same text as in the provided image about Round Bar (stock details, user industries, range, stainless steel, duplex steel).
   - Include an image at the top (use `/assets/bars.jpg` placeholder if actual image not available).
   - Use Tailwind for responsive layout (2-column: image on left, text on right).
   - Include a `<table>` styled with Tailwind for the range & grades.

3. Content for `Flanges.tsx`:
   - Title: "Flanges"
   - Description: List types of flanges (Weld Neck, Slip On, Blind, Socket Weld, Lap Joint, Threaded).
   - Include available material grades & standards.
   - Add image `/assets/flanges.jpg`.

4. Content for `Fittings.tsx`:
   - Title: "Pipe Fittings"
   - List types: Elbows, Tees, Reducers, Couplings, Caps, Stub Ends.
   - Include table of sizes & material grades.
   - Add image `/assets/fittings.jpg`.

5. Content for `Fasteners.tsx`:
   - Title: "Industrial Fasteners"
   - List types: Bolts, Nuts, Screws, Washers, Studs.
   - Include table of grades & sizes.
   - Add image `/assets/fasteners.jpg`.

6. Update `App.tsx` (or your router file) to add routes:
   ```tsx
   import Bars from "./pages/Bars";
   import Flanges from "./pages/Flanges";
   import Fittings from "./pages/Fittings";
   import Fasteners from "./pages/Fasteners";

   <Route path="/bars" element={<Bars />} />
   <Route path="/flanges" element={<Flanges />} />
   <Route path="/fittings" element={<Fittings />} />
   <Route path="/fasteners" element={<Fasteners />} />
