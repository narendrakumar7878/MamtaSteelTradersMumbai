AISI O1 Round Bars
 

AISI O1 Round Bars is a general purpose oil-hardening tool steel is a versatile manganese-chromium-tungsten steel suitable for a wide variety of cold-work applications.

AISI O1 / 01 Steel is a high quality Cold work tool steel, It belong to the high quality high carbon alloy tool steel. Oil Quenched & Tempered Hardenss is 28-34 HRc. AISI O1 / 01 steel Annealing delivery hardenss less than 250HB.

AISI O1 is equivalent of DIN 2510 Tool Steel is the oil-hardening, “non-shrinking” tool steel, good cutting edge retention; high harden ability and dimensional stability during heat treatment.

Applications of O1 / 01 Round Bars :
Good machinability, good dimensional stability plus a combination of high surface hardness and moderate toughness after hardening and tempering combine to give a steel suitable for the manufacture of tooling with good tool-life and production economy. AISI 01 can be supplied in various finishes including hot-rolled, pre-machined, fine-machined and precision ground.

01 / O1 Steels are mainly used for short run tooling for cold forming dies, blanking dies, and cutting tools operating at ambient temper.

O1 / 01 Tool Steel typical applications include medium run dies, intricate press tools, drawing punches, broaches, bushings, lathe centres, chuck jaws, master cavity sinking hobs, paper cutting machine knives, plug gauges, thread gauges and precision measuring tools. Also commonly used in applications such as cams, cloth cutting knives, cold taps, reamers, collets, cutting hobs, strip slitting cutters, trimmer dies, tube expander rolls, plastic moulds and woodworking knives ature.

 

 

 

 

Heat treatment Related to O1 / 01 :
Annealing of O1 / 01 Tool steel – Slowly heated to 740-760 ℃（1364-1400℃） and allow enough times, let the steel to be thoroughly heated, Then cool slowly in the furnace. The o1 tool steel will get MAX 250 HB （Brinell hardness）.

Hardening of O1 / 01 Tool steel – O1 steels should be heated uniformly to 780-820°C (1436-1508°F) until completely heated through. If needed, the steels can be preheated at 300-500°C (572-932°F). About 30 min/per 25 mm of ruling section is to be provided and then the steels should be immediately quenched in oil.

Tempering of O1 / 01 Tool steel – Tempering of O1 steels is performed at 100-350°C (212-662°F), Soak well at the selected temperature and soak for at least one hour per 25mm of total thickness. Get Rockwell C hardness of 55 to 64.
