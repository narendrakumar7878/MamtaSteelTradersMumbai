Description
1.4410 (S32750) Plates Super Duplex Stainless Steel
 

1.4410 Plates is the most common super duplex grade in the market. UNS S32750 is a duplex especially designed for service in aggressive chloride-containing environments. It has very good resistance to localized corrosion and stress corrosion cracking in combination with high mechanical strength. It is widely used in oil & gas, hydropower, pressure vessels, pulp & paper, structural components and chemical tankers.

High mechanical properties (twice the yield strength of austenitic grades, equal yield strengths of carbon steels used for construction; high corrosion resistance (with better resistance to stress cracking than 6% Mo super austenitic stainless steels; higher localized corrosion resistance than 825 nickel based alloys; cost efficient; optimized design (weight savings, easy to erect); attractive life cycle costs (durability, limited maintenance).

Textron Steel & Alloys stocks super duplex stainless steel plates which are certified to material grades UNS S32750 and 1.4410. The steels are also compatible with the branded 2507 designation.

 

 

What is 1.4410 material?
1.4410 is shorthand for DIN 1.4410, a super duplex stainless steel also identified by the specifications UNS S32750 and ASTM A182 F53. This particular 25% Cr super duplex stainless steel.

‘Duplex’ stainless steels are a family of stainless steels that contain a mixed microstructure of austenite and ferrite phases. They offer a combination of good corrosion resistance and high strength, making them suitable for a wide range of applications.

Super Duplex stainless steels have a higher content of alloying elements, such as chromium, nickel, and molybdenum, compared to duplex stainless steels. They are based upon 25% chromium content. As such, super duplex stainless steels exhibit even greater corrosion resistance and higher strength than duplex stainless steels, making them suitable for more demanding environments.
