Description
ASTM A106 Grade B Seamless Pipes & Tubes.
Textron Steel & Alloys is one of the pioneers in Manufacturing, Stocking and Supplying of ASTM A106 Grade B Carbon Steel Pipes, which is available in market leading prices to our clients. All forged ASTM A106 GR. B Carbon Steel Seamless Pipes should be solution annealed according to the heat treatment section to restore the ferrite – austenite equilibrium.

The weld metallurgy of ASME SA 106 GR. B Carbon Steel Welded Pipes, as with other ferrite – austenitic stainless steels, has a ferrite structure during solidification. And when the weld metal temperature of ASTM A106 GR. B Carbon Steel EFW Pipes is in the 2100 Degree F to 2640 Degree F (1150 Degree C to 1450 Degree C) range, it is possible for the HAZ to increase its ferrite content.

It is the cooling of the high temp ferrite of ASME SA 106 GR. B Carbon Steel ERW Pipes that allows retransformation into austenite, yielding a ferrite – austenite weld structure.

Cooling rates of ASTM A106 GR. B Carbon Steel Round Pipes are extremely important as getting the weld area too hot, or using too much weld energy, leads to cooling rates being too slow, allowing the formation of embrittling sigma phase in the heat affected zone. Conversely, if not enough weld energy is used in ASME SA 106 GR. B Carbon Steel Square Pipes, then the cooling rates are too fast, leading to too much ferrite in the weld metal and a fragile weld joint.

ASTM A106 Grade B is a mild steel pipe material commonly used in Industrial Plants, Power Plants, Refineries and Chemical plants.

Which is typically seamless and comes in three grades A, B, and C with grade B being the most commonly used grade.
