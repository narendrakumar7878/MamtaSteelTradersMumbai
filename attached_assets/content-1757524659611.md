## Description

### **F11 Round Bars / ASTM A182 F11**

**F11 Round Bars / ASTM A182 F11** are heat resistant steels, and belongs to the ASTM A182 standard. At high temperatures, they have high temperature mechanical properties, high temperature oxidation resistance, good toughness and process performance, and have a certain resistance to hydrogen corrosion.

F11 are mainly used in pressure systems, included are flanges, fittings, valves and similar parts and widely used in the manufacture of petrochemical, coal conversion, nuclear power, steam turbine cylinders, thermal power and other large-scale equipment with harsh operating conditions and complex corrosive media.
