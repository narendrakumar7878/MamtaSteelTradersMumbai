Description
Cobalt Base Alloys ECoCr-B Welding Electrode
 

ECoCr-B Hardfacing Electrode with a rustile-basic coating. Cobalt Base Deposit of CO-CrMo-Ni. Deposit Characterized by a good metal-metal wear and Oxidation resistance upto 1000 Degree C, even in presence of sulphurous atmosphere. Good behavior to important Thermal and Mechanical Shocks, excellent resistance to cracks, highly resistant to cavitations and erosion, deposit non-magnetic welds.

ECoCr-B & ERCoCr-B electrodes and rods are similar in composition to deposits made using ECoCr-A (Cobalt 6) electrodes and rods, except for a slightly higher percentage (approximately 16%) of carbides. The alloy also has a slightly higher hardness and better abrasive and metal-to-metal wear resistance. Impact and corrosion resistance are lowered slightly. Deposits can be machined with carbide tools.
