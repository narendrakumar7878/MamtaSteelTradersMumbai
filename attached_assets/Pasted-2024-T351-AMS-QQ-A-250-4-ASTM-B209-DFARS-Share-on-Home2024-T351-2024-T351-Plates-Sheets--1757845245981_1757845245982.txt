Aluminium 2024 T351 Plates & Sheets
 

2024 T351 Plates is a Heat Treatable Aluminum Alloy known for its high strength-to-weight ratio and good fatigue resistance. It is primarily used in aerospace applications due to its suitability for fuselage skins, wing tension members, and other structural components. The alloy’s primary alloying element is copper.

Aluminium 2024 is one of the more prominent aluminium alloys. Due to the alloys good fatigue resistance, especially in thick plate form, the material is specified for use in the aerospace and military sector in fuselage applications in such areas as structures and wing tension members. With improved fracture toughness and fatigue crack growth, Alloy 2024 continues to maintain strength characteristics. The alloy is available in T3, T4 and T8 tempers and in the annealed state.

Aluminum 2024, known for its use in the aircraft industry, is an alloy that offers excellent strength. When in the annealed condition it is readily formed and has good machinability. Though it has a relatively low level of corrosion resistance, it can be machined to a high finish.
