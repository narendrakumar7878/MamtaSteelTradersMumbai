Description
Inconel 625 / Alloy 625 Nickel / UNS N06625 Seamless Pipe & Tube
 

Inconel 625 Pipe Seamless, ERW & Welded – UNS N06625 :
Inconel is a family of Austenitic Nickel Chromium based Super Alloys. Inconel 625 High Strength, Nickel based alloy, Inconel 625 exhibits Excellent Corrosion Resistance, Oxidation Resistance and Toughness. It has very high fatigue Strength, is nonmagnetic, and offers an operational temperature range from cryogenic to 2,000°F (1,093°C).

Alloy 625 Nickel Seamless Pipe is made from a Nickel Chromium Molybdenum Alloys with an addition of Niobium. High strength and toughness from cryogenic temperatures to 1800 F. Good oxidation resistance, exceptional fatigue strength, and good resistance to many corrosives.
