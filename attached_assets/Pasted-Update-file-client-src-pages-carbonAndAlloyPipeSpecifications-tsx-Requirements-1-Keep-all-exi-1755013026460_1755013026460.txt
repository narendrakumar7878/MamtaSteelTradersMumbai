Update file: client/src/pages/carbonAndAlloyPipeSpecifications.tsx

Requirements:
1. Keep all existing content in this file exactly as it is.
2. Below the existing content, add a new modern, fully responsive Tailwind CSS table using the exact data from the provided image titled "Application & Specifications of Carbon and Alloy Steel Pipes & Tubes".
3. The table should have:
   - A heading <h1> with the title "Application & Specifications of Carbon and Alloy Steel Pipes & Tubes".
   - Three columns: Application Sector, Standard / Specification Codes, Notes (if applicable).
   - Rows exactly matching the image content. All text must be copy-paste accurate to preserve keywords.
4. Apply Tailwind styling for:
   - Mobile-first responsiveness (scrollable horizontally on small screens)
   - Alternating row background colors
   - Hover highlight effects
   - Proper padding, border, and rounded corners
5. Wrap the table in a semantic <section> with an `id="carbon-alloy-pipe-specifications"` and `aria-label="Carbon and Alloy Steel Pipes and Tubes Specifications"` for accessibility and SEO.
6. Add meta tags for SEO at the top of the file:
   - <title>Carbon & Alloy Steel Pipes & Tubes Specifications | API, ASTM, IS Standards</title>
   - <meta name="description" content="Complete application and specifications of carbon and alloy steel pipes & tubes for oil & gas, automotive, boilers, railways, water, gas, sewage, and more. Includes API, ASTM, IS, BS, DIN standards.">
7. After the table, add a bullet list exactly matching the one in the provided image. Each list item should be a <li> with <strong> for keywords like 'Boiler Tubes', 'Galvanized Tubes', 'Oil and Gas Pipes', etc.
8. Ensure every important keyword (e.g., "API 5L", "ASTM A53", "IS 4270", "Carbon Steel", "Alloy Steel") is wrapped in <strong> for SEO weight.
9. Use semantic HTML5 elements (<section>, <h2>, <ul>, <table>, <thead>, <tbody>, <th>, <td>) for better Google indexing.
10. Ensure the component is fully TypeScript-compatible and uses React + Tailwind best practices.
