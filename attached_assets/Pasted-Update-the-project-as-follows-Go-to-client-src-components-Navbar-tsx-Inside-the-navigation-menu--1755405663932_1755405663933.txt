Update the project as follows:

Go to client/src/components/Navbar.tsx

Inside the navigation menu, find the dropdown under Products.

Replace the menu item "Valves" with "Angles & Channels".

Link this menu item to a new page: /angleschannels.

Create a new file:
client/src/pages/AnglesChannels.tsx

This page should be fully SEO optimized with modern UI and smooth animations.

Use keywords naturally throughout the page content, such as:

Best SS Angles Supplier Mumbai

Hot Dip Galvanized Angles Stockist India

Top Channels Supplier Mumbai

Premium Quality Angles & Channels India

IS2062 Galvanized Angles and Channels Supplier

Mild Steel Angles & Channels Distributor

Best Structural Channels Manufacturer India

A to Z SS and MS Angles Suppliers Mumbai

Take the content and specification details from the reference images provided (angles + channels product descriptions, specifications, advantages, characteristics).

Include headings, subheadings, bullet points, meta tags, alt text for images, structured data keywords for SEO.

Keep the content user-friendly but optimized for search engines.

Add modern animations (fade-in, slide-in, hover effects for cards).

Add a hero section with a bold headline like:
"Best Angles & Channels Supplier in Mumbai â€“ Premium Quality Galvanized Steel"

Below that, add product descriptions, specifications, advantages, characteristics, and a contact CTA button that links to the Contact page (opens from the top of the page, not the bottom).

Make sure the new page:

Has responsive design (mobile + desktop).

Uses semantic HTML tags (<h1>, <h2>, <p>, <ul>, <meta>, etc.) for SEO.

Adds title tag and meta description for SEO:

<title>Best Angles & Channels Supplier in Mumbai | Premium Galvanized Steel</title>
<meta name="description" content="Leading supplier and stockist of Hot Dip Galvanized Angles & Channels in Mumbai. Premium quality, IS2062 certified, corrosion-resistant steel products for industrial and construction use.">
