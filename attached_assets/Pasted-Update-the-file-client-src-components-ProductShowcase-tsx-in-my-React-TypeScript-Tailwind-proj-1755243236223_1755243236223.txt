Update the file `client/src/components/ProductShowcase.tsx` in my React + TypeScript + Tailwind project with the following changes:

1. **Remove all buttons** from the cards â€” only show the product image and product text.
2. Make the component **fully SEO optimized**:
   - Use semantic HTML tags like `<section>`, `<article>`, `<h2>`, `<p>`.
   - Write rich, keyword-dense product descriptions under each product name so that if anyone searches these product names in Google, our site ranks at the top.
   - Add alt text to each image with relevant keywords.
3. The product list is:
Pipes
Tubes
Sheets
Plates
Round Bars
Flat Bars
Square Bars
Hollow Bars
Forged Bars
Fittings
Flanges

4. **Image setting**:
- Make it so that I can change the image URL in a simple array/object at the top of the file, and the card will update automatically without editing the JSX structure.
5. **Modern hover effects**:
- Add smooth hover animation (scale up slightly, shadow, maybe subtle brightness effect).
- Ensure hover looks premium and memorable.
6. **Carousel**:
- Show multiple cards in a horizontal carousel scrolling **right to left automatically** in an infinite loop.
- Keep the current carousel logic if it exists, but make it visually more attractive and smooth.
7. **Responsive design**:
- Cards should adjust in size and layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
8. **SEO carousel**:
- Ensure all product names and descriptions are still rendered in HTML so Google can index them (avoid rendering important text only in JavaScript without hydration).
9. **Overall look**:
- This section should look premium, modern, and make users remember the website instantly.
- Keep spacing, typography, and alignment consistent for a professional feel.

Final Goal:
- The `ProductShowcase` should be the best-looking section of the site.
- It should help the site appear at the top of Google when searching for any of these products.
- It should be responsive, smooth, and high-conversion.
