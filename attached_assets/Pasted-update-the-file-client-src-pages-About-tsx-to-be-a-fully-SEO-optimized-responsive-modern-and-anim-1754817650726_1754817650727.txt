update the file client/src/pages/About.tsx to be a fully SEO-optimized, responsive, modern, and animated About page.

Requirements:

Use React + Tailwind CSS for styling, and add smooth animations (Framer Motion for fade-in, slide, and staggered animations).

Structure the page for best SEO:

Use semantic HTML tags (<section>, <article>, <header>, <main>).

Use proper heading hierarchy (<h1> for title, <h2> for subsections).

Add descriptive alt text for images.

Wrap main content in <main> with itemScope and itemType="https://schema.org/AboutPage".

Use meta description with React Helmet.

The content should be visually appealing with cards, gradient backgrounds, subtle hover effects, and animated dividers between sections.

Use a responsive two-column layout on desktop and single-column on mobile for readability.

Add scroll animations so each section fades in from bottom when visible.

Place a modern animated gradient divider line between major sections.

Make sure typography is clean and easy to read.
