Description
Stainless Steel E307-16 Welding Electrodes
 

Stainless Steel E307-16 Welding Electrodes gives a full austenite structure containing 4-5% Mn. Weld metal is highly resistant to impact, wearing and hot cracking. It is suitable for forming a buffer layer for hard facing and joining of armor steel plates that are low hardenable and work-hardening austenitic Mn steel. It can also be used for dissimilar joining C-Mn steels with austenitic and ferritic stainless steels. Typical applications include stainless steel piping in refineries and chemical plants.

Welding of 14% Mn steel, steel Armour, hardenable steel and generally all hard-to-weld steels. Joining of wear plates to each other and to their supports. Joining of stainless steels to carbon steels. Building up of rails and buttering layers before hardfacing on 14%Mn steel or on steels of unknown composition or on carbon steels. Extensively used in steel making public works, mining carrying and dredging.
