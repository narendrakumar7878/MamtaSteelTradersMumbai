OFFICE NO 20, 1st FLOOR 45/49 GULAB MOHAMAD BULDING
RAMA GALI, 2ND KUMBHARWADA
MUMBAI 400004, MAHARASHTRA, INDIA
Button: View on Google Maps (click opens location in new tab).

Icons & Interactions:

Use modern outlined icons for person, phone, email, and location (e.g., from Lucide Icons or Heroicons).

All phone numbers are clickable (tel: link) so mobile devices show "Call" option; desktop users can copy.

Email is clickable (mailto: link).

Map button is clickable and opens Google Maps in new tab.

Styling:

Use Tailwind CSS with rounded-2xl cards, soft shadows, padding, and hover effects.

Colors: Navy blue text #1a3e72, orange accent #f39c12.

Smooth fade-in & slide-up animations for each card using Framer Motion.

SEO:

Use <section> with aria-label="Contact Mamta Steel Traders".

Use semantic tags like <h1>, <address>, <a>.

Add alt attributes for any icons/images if used as <img>.

Ensure phone numbers and email are crawlable text, not just images.

Responsive Layout:

Desktop: Two columns (left contacts, right email & address).

Mobile: Stack vertically with smooth spacing.

Animation:

Cards should have a small upward motion with opacity fade-in when they appear in viewport.

Hover effect: subtle scale-up (1.02) with shadow intensity increase.

Image/Avatar:

Use the given avatar image file for director placeholders or use a generic profile icon.

Icons should match color theme and be consistent across cards.

Implementation Steps:

Create ui/contactsection.tsx component.

Add all data hardcoded for now (Prakash, Naresh, email, address).

Import in home.tsx:

tsx
Copy
Edit
import ContactSection from "@/ui/contactsection";

...
<ProductShowcase />
<ContactSection />
<StatsSection />
Ensure animations trigger on scroll using Framer Motion.

Ensure accessibility with role, aria-label, and tabIndex where needed.
