Stainless steel fittings are essential components in piping systems that enable direction changes, branch connections, size reductions, and system termination. This comprehensive guide covers all aspects of stainless steel fittings selection and application.

**Understanding Pipe Fittings:**

Pipe fittings are used to connect straight pipe sections, adapt to different sizes, branch off, or terminate piping systems. They are available in various types, materials, and connection methods.
